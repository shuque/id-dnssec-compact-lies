                 Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC
            draft-ietf-dnsop-compact-denial-of-existence-06

Abstract

   This document describes a technique to generate a signed DNS response
   on demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists
   but doesn't have any data for the queried record type.  Such answers
   require only one minimally covering NSEC or NSEC3 record, allow
   online signing servers to minimize signing operations and response
   sizes, and prevent zone content disclosure.

   This document updates RFC 4034 and 4035.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


1.  Introduction and Motivation

   One of the functions of the Domain Name System Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC) [RFC9364] is "Authenticated Denial of Existence", i.e.,
   proving that a DNS name or record type does not exist.  Normally,
   this is done by means of signed NSEC or NSEC3 records.  In the
   precomputed signature model, these records chain together existing
   names, or cryptographic hashes of them in the zone.  In the online
   signing model, described in NSEC and NSEC3 "White Lies" [RFC4470]
   [RFC7129], they are used to dynamically compute an epsilon function
   around the queried name.  A "Type Bit Maps" field in the data of the
   NSEC or NSEC3 record asserts which resource record types are present
   at the name.

   The response for a non-existent name requires up to 2 signed NSEC
   records or up to 3 signed NSEC3 records (and for online signers, the
   associated cryptographic computation), to prove that (1) the name did
   not explicitly exist in the zone, and (2) that it could not have been
   synthesized by a wildcard.

   This document describes an alternative technique, "Compact Denial of
   Existence" or "Compact Answers", to generate a signed DNS response on
   demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists but
   has no resource records associated with the queried type, i.e., it
   returns a NODATA response rather than an NXDOMAIN response.  A NODATA
   response, which has a response code (RCODE) of NOERROR and an empty
   ANSWER section, requires only one NSEC or NSEC3 record matching the
   queried name.  This has two advantages: the DNS response size is
   smaller, and it reduces the online cryptographic work involved in
   generating the response.

   The use of minimally covering NSEC or NSEC3 records also prevents
   adversaries from enumerating the entire contents of DNS zones by
   walking the NSEC chain, or by performing an offline dictionary attack
   on the hashes in the NSEC3 chain.

   This document assumes a reasonable level of familiarity with DNS
   operations and protocol terms.  Much of the terminology is explained
   in further detail in "DNS Terminology" [RFC9499].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Distinguishing non-existent names

   This method generates NODATA responses for non-existent names that
   don't match a DNS wildcard.  Since there are clearly no record types
   for such names, the NSEC Type Bit Maps field in the response will
   only contain the "NSEC" and "RRSIG" types (and in the case of NSEC3
   the Type Bit Maps field will be empty).  Tools that need to
   accurately identify non-existent names in responses cannot rely on
   this specific type bitmap because Empty Non-Terminal (ENT) names
   (which positively exist) also have no record types at the name and
   will return exactly the same Type Bit Maps field.

   This specification defines the use of a synthetic Resource Record
   type to signal the presence of a non-existent name.  The mnemonic for
   this RR type is "NXNAME", chosen to clearly distinguish it from the
   response code mnemonic NXDOMAIN.

         Type    Value  Meaning
         NXNAME  128    NXDOMAIN indicator for Compact Denial of Existence

   This RR type is added to the NSEC Type Bit Maps field for responses
   to non-existent names, in addition to the required RRSIG and NSEC
   types.  If NSEC3 is being used, this RR type is the sole entry in the
   Type Bit Maps field.  It is a "Meta-Type", as defined in [RFC6895],
   stores no data in a DNS zone, and cannot be usefully queried.
   Section 3.5 describes what a DNS resolver or authoritative server
   should do if it receives an explicit query for NXNAME.

   No special handling of this RR type is required on the part of DNS
   resolvers.  However, resolvers may optionally implement the behavior
   described in Section 5.1 (Response Code Restoration) to better
   restore NXDOMAIN visibility to various applications that may remain
   oblivious to the new NXNAME signal.

3.  Generating Responses with NSEC

   This section describes various types of answers generated by
   authoritative servers implementing Compact Denial of Existence using
   NSEC.  Section 4 describes changes needed to support NSEC3.

3.1.  Responses for Non-Existent Names

   When the authoritative server receives a query for a non-existent
   name in a zone that it serves, a NODATA response (response code
   NOERROR, empty Answer section) is generated with a dynamically
   constructed NSEC record with the owner name matching the queried name
   (QNAME) placed in the Authority section.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


   The Next Domain Name field MUST be set to the immediate lexicographic
   successor of the QNAME.  The Type Bit Maps field MUST only have the
   bits set for the following RR Types: RRSIG, NSEC, and NXNAME.  (The
   immediate lexicographic successor is the typical case of the "DNS
   Name Successor" defined in [RFC4471]).

   For example, a request for the non-existing name "a.example.com."
   would result in the following NSEC record to be generated (in DNS
   presentation format):

          a.example.com. 3600 IN NSEC \000.a.example.com. RRSIG NSEC NXNAME

   The NSEC record MUST have corresponding RRSIGs generated.

3.2.  Responses for Non-Existent Types

   When the authoritative server receives a query for a name that
   exists, but has no resource record sets associated with the queried
   type, it generates a NODATA response, with a dynamically constructed
   signed NSEC record in the Authority Section.  The owner name of the
   NSEC record matches the queried name.  The Next Domain Name field is
   set to the immediate lexicographic successor of the QNAME.  The Type
   Bit Maps field lists the available Resource Record types at the name.

   An Empty Non-Terminal is a special subset of this category, where the
   name has no resource record sets of any type (but has descendant
   names that do).  For a query for an Empty Non-Terminal, the NSEC Type
   Bit Maps field will only contain RRSIG and NSEC.  (Note that this is
   substantially different than the ENT response in precomputed NSEC,
   where the NSEC record has the same type bitmap, but "covers" rather
   than matches the ENT, and has the Next Domain Name field set to the
   next lexicographic descendent of the ENT in the zone.)

3.3.  Responses for Wildcard Matches

   For wildcard matches, the authoritative server will provide a
   dynamically signed response that claims that the queried name exists
   explicitly.  Specifically, the answer RR set will have an RRSIG
   record demonstrating an exact match (i.e., the label count in the
   RRSIG RDATA will be equal to the number of labels in the query name
   minus the root label).  This obviates the need to include an NSEC
   record in the Authority section of the response that shows that no
   closer match than the wildcard was possible.








Huque, et al.            Expires 27 August 2025                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


   For a Wildcard NODATA match (where the queried name matches a
   wildcard but no data for the queried type exists), a response akin to
   a non-wildcard NODATA is returned.  The Answer section is empty, and
   the Authority section contains a single NSEC record that matches the
   query name with a Type Bit Maps field representing the list of types
   available at the wildcard.

3.4.  Responses for Unsigned Referrals

   Per the DNSSEC protocol, a referral to an unsigned subzone includes
   an NSEC record whose Owner Name matches the subzone, and which proves
   the delegation is unsigned by the absence of the DS RRtype bit in the
   Type Bit Maps field.

   With Compact Denial of Existence, the Next Domain Name field for this
   NSEC record is computed with a slightly different epsilon function
   than the immediate lexicographic successor of the Owner Name, as that
   name would then fall under the delegated subzone.  Instead, the Next
   Domain Name field is formed by appending a zero octet to the first
   label of the Owner Name.

   For example, a referral response for the subzone sub.example.com
   would include an NSEC record like the following:

          sub.example.com. 3600 IN NSEC sub\000.example.com. NS RRSIG NSEC

3.5.  Responses to explicit queries for NXNAME

   NXNAME is a meta type which should not appear anywhere in a DNS
   message apart from the NSEC type bitmap of a Compact Answer response
   for a non-existent name.  If however a DNS server implementing this
   specification receives an explicit query for the NXNAME RR type, this
   section describes what the response should be.

   If an explicit query for the NXNAME RR type is received, the DNS
   server MUST return a Format Error (response code FORMERR).  A
   resolver should not forward these queries upstream or attempt
   iterative resolution.  Many DNS server implementations already return
   errors for all types in the meta and q-type range except those types
   that are already defined to support queries.

   Optionally, a DNS server MAY also include the following [RFC8914]
   Extended DNS Error (EDE) Code in the response:

            INFO-CODE  Purpose
            30         Invalid Query Type

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


   Note that this EDE code is generally applicable to any RR type that
   should not appear in DNS queries.

4.  Generating Responses with NSEC3

   The NSEC3 protocol [RFC5155] uses hashed names to provide zone
   enumeration defense.  This protection is already better provided by
   minimally covering NSEC records.  NSEC3's Opt-Out feature also
   provides no specific benefit for online signing implementations
   (minimally covering NSEC3 records provide no useful Opt-Out span).
   Hence, there is no known advantage to implementing Compact Denial of
   Existence with NSEC3.  However, an existing implementation of
   traditional NSEC3 online signing migrating to Compact Denial of
   Existence may find it simpler to do so with NSEC3 than implementing
   NSEC from scratch.

   For NSEC3, the functional details of the protocol remain as described
   in Section 3, with the following changes:

   NSEC3 records and their signatures are dynamically generated instead
   of NSEC.

   The NSEC3 parameters should be set to algorithm 1, a flags field of
   0, an additional hash iteration count of 0, and an empty salt.  In
   DNS presentation format, this is "1 0 0 -".

   The Owner Name of the NSEC3 resource record is the NSEC3 hash of the
   relevant domain name, encoded in Base32 with Extended Hex Alphabet
   ([RFC4648], Section 7), prepended as a single label to the name of
   the zone.  The Next Hashed Owner Name is the immediate name successor
   of the unencoded binary form of the previous hash, which can be
   computed by adding one to the binary hash value.

   In responses for non-existent names, the Type Bit Maps field will
   contain only the NXNAME meta-type.  In responses to Empty Non-
   Terminal names, the Type Bit Maps field will be empty.

   For example, a request for the non-existent name "a.example.com."
   would result in the following NSEC3 record to be generated:

        H64KFA4P1ACER2EBPS9QSDK6DNP8B3JQ.example.com. IN NSEC3 1 0 0 - (
                          H64KFA4P1ACER2EBPS9QSDK6DNP8B3JR NXNAME )

   Unlike Compact Denial of Existence with NSEC, no special form of the
   next name field for unsigned referrals is needed.  The Hashed Next
   Owner Name field remains the NSEC3 hash of original owner name plus
   one.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


5.  Response Code Restoration

   For non-existent names, implementations should try wherever possible,
   to preserve the response code value of 3 (NXDOMAIN).  This is
   generally possible for non-DNSSEC enabled queries, namely those which
   do not set the DNSSEC_OK EDNS flag (DO bit).  For such queries,
   authoritative servers implementing Compact Denial of Existence could
   return a normal NXDOMAIN response.  There may be limited benefit to
   doing this however, since most modern DNS resolvers are DNSSEC-aware,
   and by [RFC3225] Section 3, DNSSEC-aware recursive servers are
   required to set the DO bit on outbound queries, regardless of the
   status of the DO bit on incoming requests.

   A validating resolver that understands the NXNAME signal from an
   authoritative server could modify the response code from NOERROR to
   NXDOMAIN in responses they return to downstream queriers that have
   not set the DO bit in their requests.

5.1.  Signaled Response Code Restoration

   This section describes an optional but recommended scheme to permit
   signaled restoration of the NXDOMAIN RCODE for DNSSEC enabled
   responses.  A new EDNS0 [RFC6891] header flag is defined in the 2nd
   most significant bit of the flags field in the EDNS0 OPT header.
   This flag is referred to as the "Compact Answers OK (CO)" flag.

                   +0 (MSB)                +1 (LSB)
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         0: |   EXTENDED-RCODE      |       VERSION         |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         2: |DO|CO|                 Z                       |
            +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   When this flag is sent in a query by a resolver, it indicates that
   the resolver will accept a signed NXNAME enhanced NODATA response for
   a non-existent name together with the response code field set to
   NXDOMAIN (3).

   In responses to such queries, a Compact Denial authoritative server
   implementing this signaling scheme, will set the Compact Answers OK
   EDNS header flag, and for non-existent names will additionally set
   the response code field to NXDOMAIN.

   EDNS is a hop by hop signal, so resolvers will need to record the
   presence of this flag in associated cache data and respond to
   downstream DNSSEC enabled queriers appropriately.  If the querier
   does not set the Compact Answers OK flag, the resolver will need to
   reset the response code back to NOERROR (0) for an NXNAME response.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


6.  Operational Implications

   For DNSSEC enabled queries, a signed zone at an authoritative server
   implementing Compact Answers will never return a response with a
   response code of NXDOMAIN, unless they have implemented the optional
   response code restoration feature described in Section 5.1.
   Similarly, resolvers not implementing this feature will also not be
   able to return NXDOMAIN.  In the absence of this, tools that rely on
   accurately determining non-existent names will need to infer them
   from the presence of the NXNAME RR type in the Type Bit Maps field of
   the NSEC record in NODATA responses from these servers.

   Address lookup functions typically invoked by applications may need
   to do more work when dealing with implementations of Compact Answers.
   For example, a NODATA response to the lookup of an AAAA record for a
   non-existent name, can cause such functions to issue another query at
   the same name for an A record.  Whereas an NXDOMAIN response to the
   first query could suppress additional queries for other types at that
   name.  Address lookup functions could be enhanced to issue DNSSEC
   enabled queries and to examine the NSEC Type Bit Maps field in
   responses to accurately determine non-existent names.  Note that this
   is less of a concern with Happy Eyeballs [RFC8305] style of
   connection functions that typically issue back to back DNS queries
   without waiting for individual responses.

   Protocol optimizations that enable DNS resolvers to synthesize
   NXDOMAIN or wildcard responses, like [RFC8020] and [RFC8198], cannot
   be realized from responses that use Compact Denial of Existence.  In
   general, no online signing scheme that employs minimally covering
   NSEC or NSEC3 records (including this one) permits RFC 8198 style
   NXDOMAIN or wildcard response synthesis.  Additionally, this protocol
   also precludes RFC 8020 style NXDOMAIN synthesis for DNSSEC enabled
   responses.

7.  Updates to RFCs

7.1.  Updates to RFC 4034

   [RFC4034] Section 4.1.2, The Type Bit Maps Field, states the
   following:

   *  Bits representing pseudo-types MUST be clear, as they do not
      appear in zone data.  If encountered, they MUST be ignored upon
      being read.

   This paragraph is updated to the following:





Huque, et al.            Expires 27 August 2025                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


   *  Bits representing pseudo-types MUST be clear, as they do not
      appear in zone data.  If encountered, they MUST be ignored upon
      being read.  There is one exception to this rule for Compact
      Denial of Existence (RFC TBD), where the NXNAME pseudo-type is
      allowed to appear in responses to non-existent names.

   Note: as a practical matter, no known resolver insists that pseudo-
   types must be clear in the NSEC Type Bit Maps, so this restriction
   (prior to its revision) has posed no problem for the deployment of
   this mechanism.

7.2.  Updates to RFC 4035

   [RFC4035] Section 2.3, Including NSEC RRs in a Zone, states the
   following:

   *  An NSEC record (and its associated RRSIG RRset) MUST NOT be the
      only RRset at any particular owner name.  That is, the signing
      process MUST NOT create NSEC or RRSIG RRs for owner name nodes
      that were not the owner name of any RRset before the zone was
      signed.  The main reasons for this are a desire for namespace
      consistency between signed and unsigned versions of the same zone
      and a desire to reduce the risk of response inconsistency in
      security oblivious recursive name servers.

   This paragraph is updated to the following::

   *  An NSEC record (and its associated RRSIG RRset) MUST NOT be the
      only RRset at any particular owner name.  That is, the signing
      process MUST NOT create NSEC or RRSIG RRs for owner name nodes
      that were not the owner name of any RRset before the zone was
      signed.  The main reasons for this are a desire for namespace
      consistency between signed and unsigned versions of the same zone
      and a desire to reduce the risk of response inconsistency in
      security oblivious recursive name servers.  This concern only
      applies to implementations of DNSSEC that employ pre-computed
      signatures.  There is an exception to this rule for online signing
      implementations of DNSSEC (e.g., Minimally Covering NSEC, and
      Compact Denial of Existence), where dynamically generated NSEC
      records can be produced for owner names that don't exist or are
      empty non-terminals.

8.  Security Considerations

   Online signing of DNS records requires authoritative servers for the
   DNS zone to have access to the private signing keys.  Exposing
   signing keys on Internet reachable servers makes them more vulnerable
   to attack.



Huque, et al.            Expires 27 August 2025                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


   Additionally, generating signatures on-demand is more computationally
   intensive than returning pre-computed signatures.  Although the
   Compact Answers scheme reduces the number of online signing
   operations compared to previous techniques like White Lies, it still
   may make authoritative servers more vulnerable to computational
   denial of service attacks than pre-computed signatures.  The use of
   signature algorithms (like those based on Elliptic Curves) that have
   a comparatively low cost for signing is recommended.

   Some security tools rely on detection of non-existent domain names by
   examining the response code field of DNS response messages.  A
   NOERROR code in that field rather than NXDOMAIN will impact such
   tools.  Implementation of the optional response code restoration
   scheme will help recover NXDOMAIN visibility for these tools.  Note
   that the DNS header is not cryptographically protected, so the
   response code field cannot be authenticated.  Thus inferring the
   status of a response from signed data in the body of the DNS message
   is actually more secure.  These tools could be enhanced to recognize
   the (signed) NXNAME signal.

   Because this method does not allow for aggressive negative caching
   among resolvers, it allows for certain types of denial-of-service
   attacks to be more effective.  This includes so-called Pseudorandom
   Subdomain Attacks [PRSD-ATTACK], where random names are queried,
   either directly via botnets or across a wide range of public resolver
   services, in order to intentionally generate non-existence responses
   from the authoritative servers for a domain.  If the resolver cannot
   synthesize NXDOMAIN responses from NSEC records, it must pass all
   queries on to the domain's authority servers, making resource
   exhaustion more likely at those latter servers, if those servers do
   not have the capacity to absorb those additional queries.

   If the motivating aspects of this specification (minimizing response
   size and computational costs) are not a concern, DNSSEC deployments
   can opt for a different method (e.g., traditional online signing or
   pre-computed signatures), and avoid imposing the challenges of
   NXDOMAIN visibility.

   Ed Lewis, and John Levine.  The authors would also like to thank the
   many other members of the IETF DNS Operations working group for
   helpful comments and discussions.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to do the following:

   Allocate a new DNS Resource Record type code for NXNAME from the
   "Resource Record (RR) Types" registry in the "DNS parameters"
   registry group, from the meta type range.  Specifically, the lowest
   available number (currently 128) in the meta types range is requested
   to be allocated.  A lower number lowers the size of the Type Bit Maps
   field, which reduces the overall size of the DNS response message.

         Type    Value  Meaning
         NXNAME  128  NXDOMAIN indicator for Compact Denial of Existence

   Allocate the "Compact Answers OK" flag in the "EDNS Header Flags (16
   bits)" registry in the "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" registry
   group.  Set the Flag field to "CO", as described in Section 5.1.

   Allocate a code point for "Invalid Query Type" in the "Extended DNS
   Error Codes" registry in the "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters"
   registry group, as described in Section 3.5.

Appendix A.  Other Approaches

   In the past, some implementations of Compact Denial of Existence have
   used other means to differentiate NXDOMAIN from Empty Non-Terminals.

Internet-Draft    Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC    February 2025


   One method employed by both Cloudflare and Amazon Route53 for a
   period of time was the following: for responses to Empty Non-
   Terminals, they synthesized the NSEC Type Bit Maps to include all
   record types supported except for the queried type.  This method has
   the undesirable effect of no longer being able to reliably determine
   the existence of ENTs, and of making the Type Bit Maps field larger
   than it needs to be.  It also has the potential to confuse validators
   and others tools that infer type existence from the NSEC record.

   Another way to distinguish NXDOMAIN from ENT is to define the
   synthetic Resource Record type for ENTs instead, as specified in
   [ENT-SENTINEL].  This method was successfully deployed in the field
   by NS1 for a period of time.  This typically imposes less work on the
   server since NXDOMAIN responses are a lot more common than ENTs.  At
   the time it was deployed, it also allowed a common bitmap pattern
   ("NSEC RRSIG") to identify NXDOMAIN across this and other
   implementations that returned a broad bitmap pattern for Empty Non-
   Terminals.  However, the advantage of the NXNAME RR type is that it
   explicitly identifies NXDOMAIN responses, and allows them to be
   distinguished conclusively from potential ENT responses in other
   online signing NSEC implementations.

Appendix B.  Historical Implementation Notes

   At the time of publication, the basic Compact Denial of Existence
   method using NSEC is implemented by Cloudflare, NS1, Amazon Route53,
   and Knot DNS's optional online signing module.  From early 2021 until
   November 2023, NS1 had deployed the Empty Non-Terminal distinguisher
   [ENT-SENTINEL] using the private RR type code 65281.  A version of
   the NXNAME distinguisher using the private RR type code 65238 was
   deployed by both Cloudflare (from July 2023) and NS1 (from November
   2023) until roughly September 2024.  Since September 2024 both
   Cloudflare and NS1 have deployed NXNAME using the officially
   allocated code point of 128.  Oracle Cloud Initiative implemented
   Compact Denial of Existence using NSEC3 in October 2024.
