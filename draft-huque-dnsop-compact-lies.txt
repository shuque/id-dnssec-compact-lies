                 Compact Denial of Existence in DNSSEC
                   draft-huque-dnsop-compact-lies-00

Abstract

   This document describes a technique to generate a signed DNS response
   on demand for a non-existent name by claiming that the name exists
   but doesn't have any data for the queried record type.  Such answers
   require only one NSEC record and allow online signing servers to
   minimize signing operations and packet size.

1.  Introduction and Motivation

   One of the functions of the Domain Name System Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC) [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] [RFC5155] is "Authenticated
   Denial of Existence", i.e. proving that a DNS name or record type
   does not exist.  Normally, this is done by means of NSEC or NSEC3
   records.  In the precomputed signature model, these records chain
   together existing names, or cryptographic hashes of them in the zone.
   In the online signing model, described in NSEC and NSEC3 "White Lies"
   [RFC4470] [RFC7129], they are used to dynamically compute an epsilon
   function around the queried name.  A 'type bitmap' in the data field
   of the NSEC or NSEC3 record asserts which resource record types are
   present at the associated name.

   This document describes an alternative technique, "Compact Lies", to
   generate a signed DNS response on demand for a non-existent name by
   claiming that the name exists but has no resource records associated
   with the queried type, i.e. it returns a NODATA response rather than
   an NXDOMAIN response.  A NODATA response (which has a response code
   of NOERROR, and an empty ANSWER section) requires only one NSEC
   record matching the queried name.  This has two advantages: the DNS
   response size is smaller, and it reduces the online cryptographic
   work involved in generating the response.  By contrast, an NXDOMAIN
   response requires multiple records (up to 2 when using NSEC, and up
   to 3 when using NSEC3, and the associated computation) to prove that
   (1) the name did not explicitly exist in the zone, and (2) that it
   could not have been synthesized by a wildcard.

2.  Distinguishing NXDOMAIN from Empty Non-Terminal Names

   Since NODATA responses are generated for non-existent names, and
   there are no defined record types for the name, the NSEC type bitmap
   in the response will only contain "NSEC" and "RRSIG".  Tools that
   need to accurately identify non-existent names in responses cannot
   rely on this specific type bitmap because Empty Non-Terminal (ENT)
   names (which positively exist) also have no record types at the name
   and will return exactly the same type bitmap.

   Today, one specific implementation of Compact Lies avoids the
   NXDOMAIN identification problem by synthesizing the NSEC type bitmap
   for ENTs to include all record types supported except for the queried
   type.  This has the undesirable effect though of no longer being able
   to reliably determine the existence of ENTs.

   This document thus proposes the use of a synthetic Resource Record
   type to signal the presence of an Empty Non-Terminal name.  This RR
   type is added to the NSEC type bitmap for responses to ENTs.
   Currently, the deployed examples of this scheme are using the private
   RR type code 65281.  So the resulting type bitmap would have "NSEC
   RRSIG TYPE65281".  This document requests a formal allocation of an
   RR type code.  Note that no special handling of this RR type is
   needed on the part of DNS resolvers.

3.  Responses for Non-Existent Names

   When an authoritative server implementing compact lists receives a
   query for a non-existent name in a zone that it serves, a NODATA
   response (response code NOERROR, empty Answer section) is generated
   with a dynamically constructed NSEC record with the owner name
   matching the queried name (QNAME).

   The next name SHOULD be set to the immediate lexicographic successor
   of the QNAME.  The generated NSEC record's type bitmap MUST have only
   the RRSIG and NSEC bits set.

   For example, a request for the non-existing name a.example.com would
   cause the following NSEC record to be generated (in DNS presentation
   format):

             a.example.com. 3600 IN NSEC \000.a.example.com. RRSIG NSEC

   The NSEC record MUST have corresponding RRSIGs generated.

4.  Responses for Wildcard Matches

   For wildcard matches, a Compact Lies implementation will typically
   provide a dynamically signed response that claims that the queried
   name exists explicitly.  This obviates the need to include an NSEC
   record in the Additional section of the response that shows that no
   closer match than the wildcard was possible.

   Similarly, Wildcard NODATA responses (where the queried name matches
   a wildcard but no data for the queried type exists), a response akin
   to a regular NODATA is returned.  The Answer section is empty, and
   the Additional section contains a single NSEC response that matches
   the query name with a type bitmap representing the list of types
   available at the wildcard.

5.  Responses for Empty Non-Terminals

   When an authoritative server implementing compact lists receives a
   query for an Empty Non-Terminal name, it generates a NODATA response
   in the usual way, except that it adds the additional Empty Non-
   Terminal distinguisher RR type code in the NSEC type bitmap field.
   Corresponding RRSIG signature record(s) MUST also be generated.

          ent1.example.net.  3600 IN NSEC \000.ent.example.net. RRSIG NSEC ENT

   The RR type code for "ENT" is [TBD].  Note that this RR type only
   appears in the type bitmap of an NSEC record in responses to an Empty
   Non-Terminal name as described in this document.  It causes no
   special processing on the part of validating resolvers.  Queries for
   the ENT RR type itself at an actual Empty Non-Terminal name at an
   authoritative server implementing Compact Lies MUST elicit the
   response described in this section.

6.  Operational Implications

   A signed zone at an authoritative server implementing Compact Lies
   will never return a response with a response code of NXDOMAIN.  Tools
   that rely on accurately determining non-existent responses will need
   to infer them from the NSEC type bitmap pattern of "NSEC RRSIG".

7.  Implementation Status

   Cloudflare, NS1, and Amazon Route53 currently implement the base
   Compact Lies scheme.  NS1 additonally implements the Empty Non-
   Terminal distinguisher in the NSEC type bitmap.

8.  Security Considerations

   Online signing of DNS records requires authoritative servers for the
   DNS zone to have access to the private signing keys.  Exposing
   signing keys on Internet reachable servers makes them more vulnerable
   to attack.

   Additionally, generating signatures on-demand is more computationally
   intensive than returning pre-computed signatures.  Although the
   Compact Lies scheme reduces the number of online signing operations
   compared to previous techniques like White Lies, it still may make
   authoritative servers more vulnerable to computational denial of
   service attacks than pre-computed signature models.  The use of
   signature algorithms (like those based on Elliptic Curves) that have
   a comparatively low cost for signing is prudent.

9.  Acknowledgements

   The Compact Lies technique (then called "Black Lies") was originally
   proposed in [COMPACT-LIES] by F.  Valsorda and O.  Gudmunsson.  The
   Empty Non-Terminal sentinel RR type was originally proposed in
   [ENT-SENTINEL] by S.  Huque.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new DNS Resource Record type code for
   the Empty Non-Terminal distinguisher in the DNS parameters registry:

           ENT      [TBD]      Empty Non-Terminal Distinguisher for Compact Lies
